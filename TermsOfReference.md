## Stakeholders/Roles/Responsibilities
Personal project managed by Nicola Hearn. Ideally I will find a mentor

## Resource, financial and quality plans
The only resource currently available is the time Nicola Hearn has to work on this project. Any additional resources will be found via netowkring groups and/or the skill-sharing website 'Economy of Hours' or Fiverr. I am likely to look outside for resources for the design elements of the project.

## Work breakdown structure and schedule
Ideally, the first version of the website (with Nicola's personal goals only) will be available by May 2022.
