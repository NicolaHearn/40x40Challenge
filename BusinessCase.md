# Business Case

## Executive Summary
Purpose of this project is to make the most of a market opportunity regarding women in their 30s and 40s

* **Opportunity:** Personal Growth and Development and 'living one's best life' have been very strong lifetime drivers for women of this age for their whole lives but I think there is a gap in the market for goals that are less career-focussed and more fun. 

* **Alignment to Business Strategy:**
In this instance, the business strategy is for Nicola Hearn to practise her project management and computer coding skills. This project aligns to this goal and also the personal passions and values that Nicola holds.

* **Recommended Solution:**
A website where people can list personal goals, keep track of progress, share their journeys on social media and connect with each other. The site will not be 'women only' but it will look and feel 'female-first'. 

* **Expected costs and benefits:**
The benefits are primarily personal to Nicola Hearn as a learning experience - learning to create an app. In future, it is likely the app will be marketed and sold via the usual routes. At this stage investment is not necessary.

## Business Opportunity
### Environmental Analysis
Personal Growth and Development and 'living one's best life' have been very strong lifetime drivers for women of this age for their whole lives but I think there is a gap in the market for goals that are less career-focussed and more fun. Women in their late 30s and early 40s. Womenof this age are part of the millenial generation and have no blueprint/role models for what they want the future to look like. These women are quietly hitting goals, achieving the extraordinary and in general want and expect more from life. Women have more purchasing power than ever before and would be willing to pay for such an app.

* #### Processes/Technology: In the past, women have been seen as being 'in decline' once they reach their mid-thirties and a lot of technology related to personal development and 'hobbies', particularly around fitness feels very male-oriented. I would like to offer women of this age-group their own inspirational platform. 

* #### Unaware of competitors but further research is required

* #### New technology trends - further research required

* #### Commercial or operational trends which are driving changes in society

* #### Changes to statutory, legislative or other environmental requirements

### Business Problem
* Socially in the past, women have been seen as being 'in decline' once they hit their mid-thirties. Even if people don't admit this to be true I think the idea still exists in the subconcious. 

* Many women of this generation were raised with little to no knowledge of feminism and why it is important. Seeing the problems that exist in the world and in our own UK society now, many women feel quite strongly that a more equal and inclusive world would play a big part in solving these problems and understand their own role in achieving this. Women need a space to show that they are all smashing barriers in their own ways. 

* No set time-scale

* Impact of doing nothing: no signiifcant impact, this is an opportunity to be exploited.

### Business Opportunity
* Nicola Hearn has the skills or is capable of learning the skills needed to complete this project
* Ideally a first draft of the project will be available by May 2022
* Realising this project is a personal goal for Nicola Hearn and will also inspire other women to show what they are capable of.
